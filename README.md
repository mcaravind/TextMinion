# TextMinion

TextMinion.NET is to NLP what Solr is to full text search. Solr inverts documents to get a mapping from the keyword to the document. TextMinion.NET inverts documents to extract NLP primitives, and will get mappings from these primitives to the source documents.

Proposed features: Word histograms, Phrase parsing, Named Entity recognition, Relationship extraction
